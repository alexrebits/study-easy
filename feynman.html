    <h1>Feynman Technique</h1>
    <p> The <strong>Feynman Technique</strong> is a 4-step learning method originally used by the American 
        quantum physicist Richard Feynman. This process prioritizes understanding over
        rote memorization and is made up of 4 steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Perform initial learning</li>
        <li>Pretend to explain this concept to a child</li>
        <li>Identify gaps in your understanding</li>
        <li>Review, revise, repeat</li>
    </ul>
