        <p><strong>Flashcards</strong> are a classic study method primarily 
            used for memorization and active recall.

        <p> The <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> is a method of time management 
            that promotes focused work intervals. It involves 25 minutes of uninterupted 
            work followed by a 5 minute break, also known as a "Pomodoro." 4 of these Pomodoro
            cycles is followe by a 15-30 minute break.

        <p> The <Strong>Feynman Technique</Strong> is a 4-step learning method originally used by the American 
        quantum physicist Richard Feynman. This process prioritizes understanding over
        rote memorization and is made up of 4 steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perform initial learning</li>
            <li>Pretend to explain this concept to a child</li>
            <li>Identify gaps in your understanding</li>
            <li>Review, revise, repeat</li>
        </ul>
